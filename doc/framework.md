# Framework Overview

`Daylight` alters or extends Rails components.  The framework are tiny
extensions on the shoulders of giants.  See [stats](#loc-statistics).
Generally, there are 5 main parts to `Daylight`:

| Directory        | Function         |                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| lib              | Client Modules   | Additions and fixes to `ActiveResource::Base`                   |
| rails/daylight   | Server Modules   | Additions to the Rails MVC environment                          |
| rails/extensions | Rails Extensions | Patches/Fixes to Rails components and ActiveModelSerializer     |
| app, config      | Documentation    | `Rails::Engine` to provide documentation of the API             |
| spec, test       | Mock Testing     | Mock to assist API testing in either RSpec or TestUnit/MiniTest |

`Daylight` is a tiny extension on the shoulders of giants and wouldn't be possible without

## Client Modules

```ruby
require 'daylight'
```

## Server Modules

```ruby
require 'daylight/server'
```

## Rails Extensions

The Rails extensions are loaded along with the Server modules. This is the list
of extensions and the reason why they are required:

| Extension                | Reason                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| autosave_association_fix | fix `ActiveRecord::Base` autosaving `inverse_of` associations                |
| has_one_serializer_ext   | modify `ActiveModel::Serializer` to recognize belong_to :through association |
| read_only_attributes     | modfiy `ActiveModel::Serializer` to support `read_only` attributes           |
| render_json_meta         | mofify `ActiveModel::Serializer` to include metadata to the json response    |
| nested_attributes_ext    | allows `ActiveRecord::Base` association between previously existing records  |
| route_options            | extend routes to allow `associated` and `remoted` options                    |
| versioned_url_for        | uses any versioned paths for `url_for`                                       |

## Documentation

```ruby
require 'daylight/documentation'
```

Daylight documentation is an optional Rails Engine that provides autogenerated API documentation. All docs are created on the fly by examining your routes, controllers and ActiveRecord models.

It does this by examining all descendants of ActiveRecord::Base, their attributes and associations, and associated routes. Our extensions applied on top of ActiveRecord::Base allows easier access to associations/reflections and their metadata.

The examples are mostly canned, taken from the first reflection name, attribute or scope we find, depending on the example.

We use [actionpack-page_caching](https://github.com/rails/actionpack-page_caching) to cache the documentation after the first request.

## Testing

```ruby
require 'daylight/mock'
```
