# Benchmarks

Placeholder to show benchmarks of `Daylight` requests and responses.


## LOC Statistics

As an exercise we look at the lines of code at the time of writing this
documentation.  Excluding comments and empty lines, `Daylight` is really
tiny:

| Where      |  LOC |
| ---------- | ---: |
| Client     |  490 |
| Server     |  507 |
| Mock       |  174 |
| **Total**  | 1171 |
