# Installation Steps

## Client Setup

Install the gem or add it to your bundler's Gemfile:

    gem install daylight

Set up the gem in a Rails initializer on your application:

```ruby
    require 'daylight'
    
    Daylight::API.setup!({
      namespace: 'API',
      endpoint:  'http://localhost',
      version:   'v1'
    })
```

`namespace` is the module to which you wish ActiveResource object to belong

`endpoint` is the `ActiveResource#site` URL where your server is setup

`version` is the active version of your API.

Daylight assumes you're versioning your API, you can supply the `versions`
that are supported by your API and which `version` is active. `versions` defaults to `['v1']`.

## Server Setup

Install the gem (or add it to your bundler's Gemfile):
```ruby
    gem install daylight
```

In an initializer add the Rails extensions and patches:
```ruby
    require 'daylight/server'
```

## Client Documentation Rails Engine

Daylight provides a Rails App Engine for autogenerated API documentation. All docs are created on the fly by examining your routes, controllers and ActiveRecord models.

Add this to +config\application.rb+:
```ruby
    require 'daylight/documentation'
```

And mount it in your routes:
```ruby
    mount Daylight::Documentation => '/docs/api'
```

You will also need to include your client models in your application through Bundler or some other method.
